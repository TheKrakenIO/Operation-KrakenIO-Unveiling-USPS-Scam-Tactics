## Introduction

Operation KrakenIO is a pivotal project designed to expose the deceptive practices of USPS scams. Our objective is to dissect and expose the intricacies of these scams, providing insights into common file names, keywords, and the typical structure of scam websites. This initiative provides users with the knowledge and tools to identify and protect themselves against these fraudulent schemes.

## Common Directory Structure in USPS Scams

Scammers frequently use specific files to create a semblance of legitimacy in their scams. Here is an overview of the common file names and their associated roles:

- `cc.php` and `index.php`: Fake landing pages that mimic the USPS interface.
- `index2.php` & `index4.php`: These pages typically solicit credit card information.
- `index3.php`, `wait1.php`, `wait2.php`, `wait3.php`, `wait4.php`, `wait5.php`: Faux loading screens, creating an illusion of processing user input.
- `index5.php`: Initial attempts at deceptive scripts or functions, often incomplete, that mimic coding attempts.
- `Thanks.php', `thank.php`, `Thank.php`: Pages that falsely inform users about updated shipping details before redirecting them to the accurate USPS site.
- `sms.php` & `sms2.php`: Involved in feigning interaction, supposedly to receive input from the victim.

> **Note**: This is not an exhaustive list and can be modified by scammers. Please always be careful.

## Keywords and Phrases

Scammers in USPS-related frauds often utilize specific keywords and phrases to emulate official correspondence. Be particularly cautious of communications containing:

- "Immediate action required"
- "Unclaimed parcel"
- "Delivery exception"
- "Track your shipment"
- "Postal service notification"
- "Parcel"
- "Shipping Confirmation"
- "Delivery status"
- "Failure to deliver"
- "Package delivery"
- "Shipping update"
- "Urgent delivery issue"
- "Final notice for the parcel"
- "Delivery attempt failed"

These terms are strategically used to instill urgency or authenticity, prompting rash decisions without proper verification. 

## Example of Deceptive Elements

A common element in these scams is the use of fake tracking codes, such as `US9514901185421`. These codes are designed to appear legitimate but are integral to the scam's framework.

## Analyzing Scam Techniques

The scam structure and files are designed to deceive users convincingly. Key characteristics include:

- Authentic-looking landing pages.
- Fake loading screens simulating accurate processing.
- Deceptive scripts aiming to capture personal and financial information.
